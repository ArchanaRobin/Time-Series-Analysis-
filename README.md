## Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python
This chapter is an introduction to the basics of machine learning, time series data, and the intersection between the two. This is the Summary of lecture "Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python", via datacamp.

## Time Series and Machine Learning Primer Chapter 1:
## What makes a time series?
Timeseries data consists of at least two things: One, an array of numbers that represents the data itself. Two, another array that contains a timestamp for each datapoint. The timestamps can include a wide range of time data, from months of the year to nanoseconds.

## Why machine learning?
Machine learning has taken the world of data science by storm. In the last few decades, advances in computing power, algorithms, and community practices have made it possible to use computers to ask questions that were never thought possible. Machine learning is about finding patterns in data - often patterns that are not immediately obvious to the human eye. This is often because the data is either too large or too complex to be processed by a human.

Another crucial part of machine learning is that we can build a model of the world that formalizes our knowledge of the problem at hand. We can use this model to make predictions. Combined with automation, this can be a critical component of an organization's decision making.
